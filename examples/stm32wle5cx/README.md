# stm32wle5cx examples

## Overview

These examples demonstrate how to use lora-phy (and sometimes lorawan-device) on the STM32WLE5Cx platform as used on the RAK3272s boards.
The RAK3272s does not have an onboard debugger, so these examples are done using a J-Link but other probes might work and there are development boards for the RAK3272s.
